			  Cars With Guns GWT
			   By Dave LeCompte

Years and years ago, there were any number of inspirational games,
some pencil and paper tabletop games, some 8-bit games, and even some
games into the 90s. You probably know which ones I'm talking about.

Around 2000ish, I discovered SDL for C++, and I started pulling
together a game I called Cars With Guns. And then I discovered PyGame,
the Python version of SDL. And Cars With Guns went that direction.

That game had the deliberate aesthetic of being a construction-paper
only game. Anything I couldn't accomplish with construction paper
wouldn't make it in to the game.

The game got as far as some multiplayer play, but it languished.

Years later, I stumbled across WebGL, HTML5's Canvas, and the ForPlay
game framework. I'd be happier if it had a name I could mention in
polite company. But suffice it to say, it's a game framework that
targets the web (currently) and Android (not today). I imagine that
one could make a Java JAR and distribute that, if one wanted to.
